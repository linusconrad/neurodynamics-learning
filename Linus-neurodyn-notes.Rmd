# Learning Simulations
These are my notes for going through the excercises in the neuronal dynamics textbook.


```{python}
# Import brian
from brian2 import *
#activate inline use of matplotlib
# %matplotlib inline
```

Define a very simple neuron with this syntax.
The text in the apostrophe environment are the differential equations that define the behaviour.


```{python}
tau = 10*ms             # a time constant
eqs = '''
dv/dt = (1-v)/tau : 1
'''
```

Now we can put the equation into a neuron.
The equation formally typed out:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} = \frac{(1-v)}{\tau}
\end{equation}
This equation is a simple exponential decay with $\tau$ time constant.

Next we assign a Neuron with that voltage equation.
Neurons are always assigned as a neuron group.

```{python}
G = NeuronGroup(1, eqs)
```

Now we can simulate the timecourse with the run command.

```{python}
run(100*ms)
```

```{python}

```
