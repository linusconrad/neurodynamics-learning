# Learning Simulations
These are my notes for going through the excercises in the neuronal dynamics textbook.


```{python}
# Import brian
from brian2 import *
#activate inline use of matplotlib
# %matplotlib inline
```

Define a very simple neuron with this syntax.
The text in the apostrophe environment are the differential equations that define the behaviour.


```{python}
tau = 10*ms             # a time constant
eqs = '''
dv/dt = (1-v)/tau : 1
'''
```

Now we can put the equation into a neuron.
The equation formally typed out:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} = \frac{(1-v)}{\tau}
\end{equation}
This equation is a simple exponential decay with $\tau$ time constant.

Next we assign a Neuron with that voltage equation.
Neurons are always assigned as a neuron group.

```{python}
G = NeuronGroup(1, eqs)
```

Now we can simulate the timecourse with the run command.

```{python}
run(100*ms)
```

Next, we would like to simulate and look at different aspects of the model as it evolves in time.
Variables of the model at a given point in time are referred to as *states* by brian.
The following block simulates and records the time course of voltage based on the model (it should just be an exponential asymptote to 1)



```{python}
start_scope()

G = NeuronGroup(1, eqs, method='exact')
M = StateMonitor(G, 'v', record=0)

run(30*ms)

plot(M.t/ms, M.v[0])
xlabel('Time (ms)')
ylabel('v');
```

State monitor objects are used to store the information of a run.
The neurons have to be specified (here: `record = 0` option) in order to preserve memory.

Now we can introduce spiking behaviour.
Whenever the threshold is reached, voltage gets set to 0, and decays with the defined equation.

```{python}
start_scope()

tau = 10*ms
eqs = '''
dv/dt = (1-v)/tau : 1
'''

G = NeuronGroup(1, eqs, threshold='v>0.8', reset='v = 0', method='exact')

M = StateMonitor(G, 'v', record=0)
run(50*ms)
plot(M.t/ms, M.v[0])
xlabel('Time (ms)')
ylabel('v');
```

```{python}

```
