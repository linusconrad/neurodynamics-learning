# neurodynamics-learning
In this folder I am going through the lessons of the neurodynamics textbook for learning python.

This are the resources:

1. [textbook](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch1.S3.html)
2. [excercises](https://neuronaldynamics-exercises.readthedocs.io/en/latest/exercises/leaky-integrate-and-fire.html#exercise-minimal-current)
3. [brian2 docs](https://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/resources/tutorials/1-intro-to-brian-neurons.html)

All is done in a jupyter notebook that is made into an .Rmd by jupytext.
The .Rmd is versioncontrolled in this directory.
